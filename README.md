# fse-patchclone
To run the project, we need a configuration file.
If we have the jar of the project called fse-patchclone.jar, then run it by:
fse-patchclone.jar path-to-configuration-file

The configuration file is located in the resources folder of the project.
You only need to change some parameters (explained in comments in the config file
provided) to make the project run on your local machine
